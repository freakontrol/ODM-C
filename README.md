 # OpenData Management & Cloud Project: Enhancing Open Source Product Development through Product Lifecycle Management

This project is designed to enhance open source product development by implementing a robust Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system. In this README, we'll guide you through the steps required to set up and run the development server for this project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (recommended) or Python 3.x
- Git (optional but recommended for version control)

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/freakontrol/ODM-C.git
   cd ODM-C
   ```

2. **Create a Conda Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   conda create --name plm_env python=3.8
   conda activate plm_env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install django djangorestframework django-extensions
   ```

4. **Configure the Database (if needed)**
   By default, this project uses SQLite as its database. If you want to use a different database, modify the `DATABASES` setting in `PLM/settings.py`.

5. **Apply Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create an Admin User (Optional)**
   If you want to access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run Tests (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python manage.py test
   ```

8. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The development server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

   The API root endopoint is available `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

- `PLM/`: Django project settings and configurations.
- `plm/`: Django app containing models, views, templates, and other application-specific files.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Django app.
- `migrations/`: Database migration files generated by Django.
